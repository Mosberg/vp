This prompt provides Fabric-focused guidance for Minecraft 1.21.11 mod development.
Use it when generating or modifying code involving:

- Fabric API usage
- Yarn mappings
- Registries and data-driven content
- Mixins and injection strategies
- Client-only or shared logic in a split-source project

Include clear examples, imports, and version-accurate APIs.

If API naming is uncertain, validate against `.github/remote-links.md` before finalizing changes.
